# Farming-Marks
Farming Marks is a Resource Pack made by CREEPER24 that allows you to see if your Potatos for example, are at their max. Stage. This pack has a Green and Red Version of the "Marks" You can choose them if you click on the Settings button of the Pack.
This pack allows you to see a lot easier if your food and stuff is ready to farm. There are two versions available that you can choose in the Pack Settings.
There is (as i said) a red version too. Choose that version that you like the most :D
